                <p id="ChanelInfo">Gabrielle Chanel influenced fashion through eliminating gender standards. 
                    Chanel was the first to free women from wearing degrading corsets and made fashion comfortable. 
                    She influenced men due to the fact that she proved women were capable of more than just being housewives. 
                    They could work and do just as much as men, they just hadn't been given the opportunity. 
                    Chanel made fashion for women inspired by men fashion. As she designed for the working women, 
                    she designed pants with pockets, loosened the waistline and allowed women to cut their hair short. " </p>

                <p>Yves Saint Laurent, on the other hand, was inspired by precisely
                   this revolutionary atmosphere that led him to create the wardrobe 
                   of the modern woman. In the spirit of what Gabrielle Chanel had 
                   accomplished at the beginning of the 20th century, he sought to free 
                   women from the clothing that hindered them. While offering them a 
                   modern sense of comfort and elegance, he would design a wardrobe that
                   would place women on a par with men.</p>
