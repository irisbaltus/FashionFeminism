                <h1>JULIA ROBERTS</h1>  
                <p id="juliaRobertsInfo" >It all started at the global awards in 1990, this is where Julia Roberts
                achieved her first major award for her role in Magnolia Steels. Roberts wore 
                a grey men's suit from Giorgio Armani.  In 2014 she said  “I clearly didn't 
                care what anyone thought about it” in an interview. Well apperentaly everybody
                loved it. Back then it wasn't as self-evident to wear a men's suit to a red 
                carpet as nowadays. She's been a connoisseur of button-ups and suit pants. 
                It was assigned to Julia to make those gender-bending fashion statements.</p>
