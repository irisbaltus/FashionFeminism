                <h1>JULIA ROBERTS</h1>  
                <p>It all started at the global awards in 1990, this is where Julia Roberts
                achieved her first major award for her role in Magnolia Steels. Roberts wore 
                a grey men's suit from Giorgio Armani.  In 2014 she said  “I clearly didn't 
                care what anyone thought about it” in an interview. Well apperentaly everybody
                loved it. Back then it wasn't as self-evident to wear a men's suit to a red 
                carpet as nowadays. She's been a connoisseur of button-ups and suit pants. 
                It was assigned to Julia to make those gender-bending fashion statements.</p>

                        <h1>FLORENCE PUGH</h1>  
                        <p>Pugh is known for making fashion statements via bold, sheer clothing, 
                           following her viral appearance at Valentino's 2022 couture show, when 
                           she showed up in a daring hot-pink tulle gown with a completely see-through bodice. 
                            “I was comfortable with my small breasts,” she said at the time. “And showing them 
                            like that, it aggravated people that I was comfortable. … It was just alarming, how 
                            perturbed they were. They were so angry that I was confident, and they wanted to 
                            let me know that they would never wank over me. Well, don't.”</p>
