                <p>FIRST WAVE</p>
                <p>The first wave was around 1900. It mainly fought for women's
                   right to vote and access to higher education. Degrading corsets and 
                   crinolines were exchanged for wearable silhouettes. In the 1920s the
                   unimaginable became possible: women increasingly wore trousers. 
                   A development in which Gabriele Chanel played a major role with 
                   her practical and menswear-inspired designs.</p>

                <p>SECOND WAVE</p>
                <p>the position for women didn't progress enough so a second wave started 
                   late 1960s. This time 'Being your own boss', equality in the workplace
                   and traditional gender roles were on the agenda. In 1966 
                   Yves Saint Laurent designed his revolutionary women's suit Le smoking and  
                   the safari jacket two years later. Both creations were a symbol for the new 
                   male-female ratio. “Chanel liberated women, Yves Saint Laurent liberated 
                   fashion from its aura” . Feminist rejected the sexy and opressive clothing 
                   in different ways. They started dressing more masculine or completely 
                   ignored fashion in order to regain their 'natural femininity'. Bra off, 
                   armpit hair present.</p>

                <p>THIRD WAVE</p>
                <p>The feminists of the third wave of feminism build on the ideas and 
                   theoretical analyzes of the second wave of feminism. This third wave 
                   differs from the two previous ones by new methods, different goals and 
                   finding a balanced approach to diversity within society and feminism. 
                   In the fashion world, more and more designers were looking for a new 
                   femininity that would challenge the traditional gender differences in 
                   fashionA good example of this is the work of Vivienne Westwood. Initially,
                   Westwood incorporated subcultural elements from punk into her contemporary 
                   clothing. The bad girl was born. After the commercialization of punk,
                   Westwood's interest shifted in the 1980s to, among other things, the technical 
                   aspect of Victorian fashion. This resulted in collections with wearable busts, 
                   corsets and crinolines with which she emphasized the female body.</p>
